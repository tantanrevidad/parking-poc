# Smart Parking Management System — Proof of Concept (POC)

An enterprise-grade Streamlit application demonstrating every layer of the Smart Parking system end-to-end, featuring predictive availability forecasting, confidence-weighted license plate matching, real-time slot state tracking, interactive direct-click SQLite database telemetry inspection, and computer vision feasibility validation across **Megaworld Townships** (Uptown Bonifacio, Eastwood City, and McKinley Hill / Venice Grand Canal Mall).

---

## Key Highlights & Current State

- **Township Deck Layout & Sequential Ordering:** Realistic township architectural scheme organized sequentially by commercial archetype (**Mall** $\rightarrow$ **Office** $\rightarrow$ **Residential**) with labeled Drive Aisles (Lane A, Lane B, Lane C) and expanded capacity across 3 Megaworld townships (**Uptown Bonifacio**, **Eastwood City**, and **McKinley Hill / Venice Grand Canal Mall**).
- **Zero-Page-Reload Direct Stall Inspection:** Every parking stall block is an interactive solid-color card powered by isolated fragment execution (`@st.fragment`). Clicking directly on any block instantly opens the **SQLite Database Row Inspector modal (`@st.dialog`)** with zero page reload or scroll jitter, displaying real-time telemetry, tickets, OCR reads, and raw SQL queries.
- **Dynamic Real-Time PST Hero Clock (Tab 1):** Live client-side Philippine Standard Time clock counting up seconds, minutes, and hours (`HH:MM:SS AM/PM`) dynamically with zero server overhead and a pulsing live monitoring badge.
- **Streamlined Date & Time Controls (Tab 2):** Dedicated future simulation interface featuring clean, centered Date and Time selectors for rapid predictive scenario analysis across any future timestamp.
- **Real-World External Data Pipeline (`real_data_pipeline.py`):** Ingests live empirical Google Places foot-traffic curves (0–100 index), real-time Metro Manila weather telemetry from Open-Meteo API, Megaworld mall sales/events calendars, and arterial road delay estimates.
- **Philippine National Holidays Calendar (`ph_holidays.py`):** Automated statutory calendar (2024–2028) modeling zone-differentiated holiday mobility curves (commercial mall surges vs. corporate office dips).
- **Forecast Intelligence & Methodology (Tab 2):** Integrated analytical intelligence providing zone behavioral classification (Mall vs. Office vs. Residential), 4-week telemetry dataset provenance (2,688 intervals at 15-minute resolution), and detailed model specifications.
- **Stabilized Simulation State Machine:** Real-time 4-state slot tracking (`Available (Free)`, `Occupied — Unpaid`, `Occupied — Pending Match`, `Occupied — Likely Vacating Soon`) driven by simulated ticketing logs, grace periods, and stabilized 5-minute simulation window seeds.
- **Confidence-Weighted Fuzzy Matcher:** Real OCR-to-ticket matching algorithm with optical confusable-character scoring ($0 \leftrightarrow O$, $1 \leftrightarrow I$, $8 \leftrightarrow B$, $5 \leftrightarrow S$, $2 \leftrightarrow Z$, $6 \leftrightarrow G$) and margin enforcement ensuring **0% false positive ticket matches**.
- **ML Occupancy Forecasting Engine:** `scikit-learn` `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on historical readings using causal feature engineering enriched with Google busyness, weather, events, and holiday signals.
- **Dual Computer Vision ALPR Validation:**
  1. **Philippine License Plates Dataset (Roboflow Universe / LTO):** 20 authentic Philippine vehicle frames (`lpr-mgcu6/philippine-license-plates-wmxlq`) spanning LTO 2014/2018/2020 Private series (`MAT-2357`, `CAX-3200`, `LAN-3138`, `MAN-4684`, `NDU-6211`, `CBC-2080`), Legacy Rizal/Matatag series (`LHA-482`, `LEN-918`, `LGT-635`), and commercial fleet plates evaluated via multi-pass CLAHE contrast enhancement and prominence-weighted vehicle scoring.
  2. **Academic ALPR Benchmark (OpenALPR):** 14 curated international benchmark photographs with hand-verified ground truth plates.
- **5-Phase Computer Vision Space Detection Engine:** YOLOv8n vehicle detector with adaptive low-light CLAHE contrast enhancement, true perspective polygon ROI calibration (`slots_config.json`), Intersection over Area (IoA) occupancy scoring with centroid containment, and 5-frame temporal sliding-window state debouncing ($\ge 60\%$ consensus).
- **Enterprise Dark & Light Mode Theme Engine:** Dynamic theme switcher with bulletproof contrast across all widgets, BaseWeb calendars, popover dropdowns, custom unindented HTML tables (`render_styled_match_table`), custom inline code badges, and adaptive Plotly charts.

## What's Real vs. Simulated

| Component | Status | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Camera Feed / Slot Occupancy** | **Simulated** | Synthetic 28-day 15-minute time series generated with zone-specific mathematical curves + Gaussian noise + event multipliers. |
| **License Plate OCR (App Live Stream)** | **Simulated** | Synthetic reads corrupted via an optical confusion matrix ($0/O, 1/I, 8/B, 5/S, 2/Z, 6/G$) with randomized confidence scores. |
| **Ticketing POS Integration** | **Simulated** | SQLite relational transaction log (`ticketing_records` in `data/parking.db`) tracking entry, payment timestamp, and ticket status. |
| **Plate-to-Ticket Matching Algorithm** | **Real** | Confidence-weighted Levenshtein matching with confusable character penalty discounts in `matcher.py`. |
| **Slot State Machine Engine** | **Real** | State transition rules in `state_machine.py` modeling Free, Unpaid, Pending Match, and Vacating states. |
| **ML Predictive Forecaster** | **Real** | `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` in `predictor.py` trained with time-based holdout validation, MAE metrics, and permutation feature importance. |
| **Computer Vision ALPR Pipeline** | **Real** | YOLOv8n prominence vehicle detection + Sobel-X vertical edge plate localization + multi-pass CLAHE OCR + real candidate matching in `cv_demo.py`. |
| **Computer Vision Space Detector** | **Real** | 5-phase ROI & IoA vehicle detection engine with CLAHE enhancement & temporal debouncing in `parking_detector.py`. |

## Inspecting SQLite Database Records

The persistent relational database is stored locally in `data/parking.db`.

### Method A: In-Dashboard Direct Click Inspection
1. Navigate to **Tab 1: Occupancy Map**.
2. Click **directly on any colored parking stall block** (`M-001`, `O-001`, `R-001`, etc.).
3. An interactive modal dialog opens instantly (with zero page reload via `@st.fragment`) displaying:
   - **Active Live Telemetry** — Consolidated snapshot of state, ticket, and OCR reading.
   - **Active Occupancy State (`current_state`)** — Current status and state change timestamp.
   - **Ticketing & Settlement (`ticketing_records`)** — Assigned vehicle plate, entry time, payment settlement time.
   - **Optical Plate Read (`plate_reads`)** — Camera OCR detected text, confidence vector, ground truth plate.
   - **Infrastructure Metadata (`slots` & `zones`)** — Deck level, archetype, township site, zone capacity.
   - **Executed SQLite Statement (Raw SQL)** — Underlying parameterized SQL statement executed against `data/parking.db`.

## Zone Archetypes

- **Office Zones:** Morning surge (08:00–09:30), slight midday dip (12:00–13:00), evening drain after 17:30. Minimal weekend volume.
- **Mall Zones:** Gradual morning volume, sustained afternoon build, peak evening traffic (18:00–21:30), +35% higher traffic on weekends.
- **Residential Zones:** High overnight occupancy (85–95%), workday drop (08:00–17:00), consistent profile across weekdays and weekends.
